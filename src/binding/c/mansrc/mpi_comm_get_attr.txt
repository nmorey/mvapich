/*D
   MPI_Comm_get_attr - Retrieves attribute value by key

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Comm_get_attr(MPI_Comm comm, int comm_keyval, void *attribute_val,
                      int *flag)
.ve

Input Parameters:
+ comm - communicator to which the attribute is attached (handle)
- comm_keyval - key value (integer)

Output Parameters:
+ attribute_val - attribute value, unless flag = false (None)
- flag - false if no attribute is associated with the key (logical)

Notes:
    Attributes must be extracted from the same language as they were inserted
    in with 'MPI_ATTR_PUT'.  The notes for C and Fortran below explain why.

.N ThreadSafe

Notes for C:
    Even though the 'attribute_val' argument is declared as 'void *', it is
    really the address of a void pointer (i.e., a 'void **').  Using
    a 'void *', however, is more in keeping with C idiom and allows the
    pointer to be passed without additional casts.

.N Fortran
    The 'attribute_val' in Fortran is a pointer to a Fortran integer, not
    a pointer to a 'void *'.
