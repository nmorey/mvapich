/*D
   MPI_Get_processor_name - Gets the name of the processor

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Get_processor_name(char *name, int *resultlen)
.ve

Output Parameters:
+ name - A unique specifier for the actual (as opposed to virtual) node. (string)
- resultlen - Length (in printable characters) of the result returned in name (integer)

Notes:
The name returned should identify a particular piece of hardware;
the exact format is implementation defined.  This name may or may not
be the same as might be returned by 'gethostname', 'uname', or 'sysinfo'.

.N ThreadSafe

.N Fortran

 In Fortran, the character argument should be declared as a character string
 of 'MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME' rather than an array of dimension
 'MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME'.  That is,
.vb
   character*(MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME) name
.ve
 rather than
.vb
   character name(MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME)
.ve

 The sizes of MPI strings in Fortran are one less than the sizes of that string in C/C++ because the C/C++ versions provide room for the trailing null character required by C/C++. For example, MPI_MAX_ERROR_STRING is mpif.h is one smaller than the same value in mpi.h. See the MPI standard, sections 2.6.2 and 4.12.9.
