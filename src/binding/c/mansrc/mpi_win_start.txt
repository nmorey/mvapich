/*D
   MPI_Win_start - Start an RMA access epoch for MPI

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Win_start(MPI_Group group, int assert, MPI_Win win)
.ve

Input Parameters:
+ group - group of target processes (handle)
. assert - program assertion (integer)
- win - window object (handle)

Notes:
The 'assert' argument is used to indicate special conditions for the
fence that an implementation may use to optimize the 'MPI_Win_start'
operation.  The value zero is always correct.  Other assertion values
may be or''ed together.  Assertions that are valid for 'MPI_Win_start' are\:

. MPI_MODE_NOCHECK - the matching calls to 'MPI_WIN_POST' have already
  completed on all target processes when the call to 'MPI_WIN_START' is made.
  The nocheck option can be specified in a start call if and only if it is
  specified in each matching post call. This is similar to the optimization
  of ready-send that may save a handshake when the handshake is implicit in
  the code. (However, ready-send is matched by a regular receive, whereas
  both start and post must specify the nocheck option.)
