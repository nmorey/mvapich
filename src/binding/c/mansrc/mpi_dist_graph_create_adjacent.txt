/*D
   MPI_Dist_graph_create_adjacent - returns a handle to a new communicator to which the distributed graph topology information is attached

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Dist_graph_create_adjacent(MPI_Comm comm_old, int indegree,
                                   const int sources[],
                                   const int sourceweights[], int outdegree,
                                   const int destinations[],
                                   const int destweights[], MPI_Info info,
                                   int reorder, MPI_Comm *comm_dist_graph)
.ve

Input Parameters:
+ comm_old - input communicator (handle)
. indegree - size of sources and sourceweights arrays (non-negative integer)
. sources - ranks of processes for which the calling process is a destination (non-negative integer)
. sourceweights - weights of the edges into the calling process (non-negative integer)
. outdegree - size of destinations and destweights arrays (non-negative integer)
. destinations - ranks of processes for which the calling process is a source (non-negative integer)
. destweights - weights of the edges out of the calling process (non-negative integer)
. info - hints on optimization and interpretation of weights (handle)
- reorder - the ranks may be reordered (true) or not~(false)

Output Parameters:
. comm_dist_graph - communicator with distributed graph topology (handle)
