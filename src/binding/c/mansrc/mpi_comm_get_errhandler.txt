/*D
   MPI_Comm_get_errhandler - Get the error handler attached to a communicator

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Comm_get_errhandler(MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Errhandler *errhandler)
.ve

Input Parameters:
. comm - communicator (handle)

Output Parameters:
. errhandler - error handler currently associated with communicator (handle)

Note on Implementation:

The MPI Standard was unclear on whether this routine required the user to call
'MPI_Errhandler_free' once for each call made to this routine in order to
free the error handler.  After some debate, the MPI Forum added an explicit
statement that users are required to call 'MPI_Errhandler_free' when the
return value from this routine is no longer needed.  This behavior is similar
to the other MPI routines for getting objects; for example, 'MPI_Comm_group'
requires that the user call 'MPI_Group_free' when the group returned
by 'MPI_Comm_group' is no longer needed.
