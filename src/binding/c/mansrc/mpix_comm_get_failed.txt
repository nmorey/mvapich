/*D
   MPIX_Comm_get_failed - This local operation returns the group of processes that are locally known to have failed.

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPIX_Comm_get_failed(MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Group *failedgrp)
.ve

Input Parameters:
. comm - communicator (handle)

Output Parameters:
. failedgrp - group of failed processes (handle)

Notes:
The returned failedgrp can be empty, that is, equal to MPI_GROUP_EMPTY.

For any two groups obtained from calls to this routine at the same MPI process with the same comm, the smaller group is a prefix of the larger group, that is, the same failed process will have the same rank in the returned failedgrp.
