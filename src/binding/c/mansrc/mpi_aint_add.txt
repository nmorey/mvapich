/*D
   MPI_Aint_add - Returns the sum of base and disp

Synopsis:
.vb
MPI_Aint MPI_Aint_add(MPI_Aint base, MPI_Aint disp)
.ve

Input Parameters:
+ base - base address (integer)
- disp - displacement (integer)

Notes:
MPI_Aint_Add produces a new MPI_Aint value that is equivalent to the sum of the
base and disp arguments, where base represents a base address returned by a call
to MPI_GET_ADDRESS and disp represents a signed integer displacement. The resulting
address is valid only at the process that generated base, and it must correspond
to a location in the same object referenced by base. The addition is performed in
a manner that results in the correct MPI_Aint representation of the output address,
as if the process that originally produced base had called
.vb
    MPI_Get_address((char *) base + disp, &result)
.ve
