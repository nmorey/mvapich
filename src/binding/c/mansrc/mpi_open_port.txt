/*D
   MPI_Open_port - Establish an address that can be used to establish connections between groups of MPI processes

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Open_port(MPI_Info info, char *port_name)
.ve

Input Parameters:
. info - implementation-specific information on how to establish an address (handle)

Output Parameters:
. port_name - newly established port (string)

Notes:
MPI copies a system-supplied port name into 'port_name'. 'port_name' identifies
the newly opened port and can be used by a client to contact the server.
The maximum size string that may be supplied by the system is
'MPI_MAX_PORT_NAME'.

 Reserved Info Key Values:
+ ip_port - Value contains IP port number at which to establish a port.
- ip_address - Value contains IP address at which to establish a port.
 If the address is not a valid IP address of the host on which the
 'MPI_OPEN_PORT' call is made, the results are undefined.
