/*D
   MPI_Win_set_info - Set new values for the hints of the window associated with win

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Win_set_info(MPI_Win win, MPI_Info info)
.ve

Input Parameters:
+ win - window object (handle)
- info - info argument (handle)

Notes:

Some info items that an implementation can use when it creates a window cannot
easily be changed once the window has been created. Thus, an implementation may
ignore hints issued in this call that it would have accepted in a creation
call.
