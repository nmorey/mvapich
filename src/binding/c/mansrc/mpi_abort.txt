/*D
   MPI_Abort - Terminates MPI execution environment

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Abort(MPI_Comm comm, int errorcode)
.ve

Input Parameters:
+ comm - communicator of tasks to abort (handle)
- errorcode - error code to return to invoking environment (integer)

Notes:
Terminates all MPI processes associated with the communicator 'comm'; in
most systems (all to date), terminates `all` processes.

.N NotThreadSafe
Because the 'MPI_Abort' routine is intended to ensure that an MPI
process (and possibly an entire job), it cannot wait for a thread to
release a lock or other mechanism for atomic access.

.N Fortran

.N Errors
.N MPI_SUCCESS
.N MPI_ERR_COMM
.N MPI_ERR_OTHER
