/*D
   MPI_Finalize - Terminates MPI execution environment

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Finalize(void)
.ve

Notes:
All processes must call this routine before exiting.  The number of
processes running `after` this routine is called is undefined;
it is best not to perform much more than a 'return rc' after calling
'MPI_Finalize'.

Thread and Signal Safety:
The MPI standard requires that 'MPI_Finalize' be called `only` by the same
thread that initialized MPI with either 'MPI_Init' or 'MPI_Init_thread'.
