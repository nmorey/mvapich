/*D
   MPI_Query_thread - Return the level of thread support provided by the MPI library

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Query_thread(int *provided)
.ve

Output Parameters:
. provided - provided level of thread support (integer)

Notes:
The valid values for the level of thread support are\:
+ MPI_THREAD_SINGLE - Only one thread will execute.
. MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED - The process may be multi-threaded, but only the main
thread will make MPI calls (all MPI calls are funneled to the
main thread).
. MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED - The process may be multi-threaded, and multiple
threads may make MPI calls, but only one at a time: MPI calls are not
made concurrently from two distinct threads (all MPI calls are serialized).
- MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE - Multiple threads may call MPI, with no restrictions.

If 'MPI_Init' was called instead of 'MPI_Init_thread', the level of
thread support is defined by the implementation.  This routine allows
you to find out the provided level.  It is also useful for library
routines that discover that MPI has already been initialized and
wish to determine what level of thread support is available.
