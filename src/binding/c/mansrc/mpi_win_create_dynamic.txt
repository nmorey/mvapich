/*D
   MPI_Win_create_dynamic - Create an MPI Window object for one-sided communication

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Win_create_dynamic(MPI_Info info, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Win *win)
.ve

Input Parameters:
+ info - info argument (handle)
- comm - intra-communicator (handle)

Output Parameters:
. win - window object returned by the call (handle)

Notes:

Users are cautioned that displacement arithmetic can overflow in variables of
type 'MPI_Aint' and result in unexpected values on some platforms. This issue may
be addressed in a future version of MPI.

Memory in this window may not be used as the target of one-sided accesses in
this window until it is attached using the function 'MPI_Win_attach'. That is, in
addition to using 'MPI_Win_create_dynamic' to create an MPI window, the user must
use 'MPI_Win_attach' before any local memory may be the target of an MPI RMA
operation. Only memory that is currently accessible may be attached.
