/*D
   MPI_T_init_thread - Initialize the MPI_T execution environment

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_T_init_thread(int required, int *provided)
.ve

Input Parameters:
. required - desired level of thread support (integer)

Output Parameters:
. provided - provided level of thread support (integer)

Notes:
  The valid values for the level of thread support are:
+ MPI_THREAD_SINGLE - Only one thread will execute.
. MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED - The process may be multi-threaded, but only the main
  thread will make MPI_T calls (all MPI_T calls are funneled to the
  main thread).
. MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED - The process may be multi-threaded, and multiple
  threads may make MPI_T calls, but only one at a time: MPI_T calls are not
  made concurrently from two distinct threads (all MPI_T calls are serialized).
- MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE - Multiple threads may call MPI_T, with no restrictions.
