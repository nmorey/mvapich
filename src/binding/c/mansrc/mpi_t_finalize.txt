/*D
   MPI_T_finalize - Finalize the MPI tool information interface

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_T_finalize(void)
.ve

Notes:
This routine may be called as often as the corresponding MPI_T_init_thread() routine
up to the current point of execution. Calling it more times returns a corresponding
error code. As long as the number of calls to MPI_T_finalize() is smaller than the
number of calls to MPI_T_init_thread() up to the current point of execution, the MPI
tool information interface remains initialized and calls to its routines are permissible.
Further, additional calls to MPI_T_init_thread() after one or more calls to MPI_T_finalize()
are permissible. Once MPI_T_finalize() is called the same number of times as the routine
MPI_T_init_thread() up to the current point of execution, the MPI tool information
interface is no longer initialized. The interface can be reinitialized by subsequent calls
to MPI_T_init_thread().

At the end of the program execution, unless MPI_Abort() is called, an application must
have called MPI_T_init_thread() and MPI_T_finalize() an equal number of times.
