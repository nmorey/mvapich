/*D
   MPI_Wtick - Returns the resolution of MPI_Wtime

Synopsis:
.vb
double MPI_Wtick(void)
.ve

  Return value:
  Time in seconds since an arbitrary time in the past.

  Notes:
  This is intended to be a high-resolution, elapsed (or wall) clock.
  See 'MPI_WTICK' to determine the resolution of 'MPI_WTIME'.
  If the attribute 'MPI_WTIME_IS_GLOBAL' is defined and true, then the
  value is synchronized across all processes in 'MPI_COMM_WORLD'.

  Notes for Fortran:
  This is a function, declared as 'DOUBLE PRECISION MPI_WTIME()' in Fortran.
