/*D
   MPI_Win_post - Start an RMA exposure epoch

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Win_post(MPI_Group group, int assert, MPI_Win win)
.ve

Input Parameters:
+ group - group of origin processes (handle)
. assert - program assertion (integer)
- win - window object (handle)

Notes:
The 'assert' argument is used to indicate special conditions for the
fence that an implementation may use to optimize the 'MPI_Win_post'
operation.  The value zero is always correct.  Other assertion values
may be or''ed together.  Assertions that are valid for 'MPI_Win_post' are\:

+ MPI_MODE_NOCHECK - the matching calls to 'MPI_WIN_START' have not yet
  occurred on any origin processes when the call to 'MPI_WIN_POST' is made.
  The nocheck option can be specified by a post call if and only if it is
  specified by each matching start call.
. MPI_MODE_NOSTORE - the local window was not updated by local stores (or
  local get or receive calls) since last synchronization. This may avoid
  the need for cache synchronization at the post call.
- MPI_MODE_NOPUT - the local window will not be updated by put or accumulate
  calls after the post call, until the ensuing (wait) synchronization. This
  may avoid the need for cache synchronization at the wait call.
