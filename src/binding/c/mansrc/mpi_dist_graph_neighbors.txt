   MPI_Dist_graph_neighbors - Provides adjacency information for a distributed graph topology

Synopsis:
.vb
int MPI_Dist_graph_neighbors(MPI_Comm comm, int maxindegree, int sources[],
                             int sourceweights[], int maxoutdegree,
                             int destinations[], int destweights[])
.ve

Input Parameters:
+ comm - communicator with distributed graph topology (handle)
. maxindegree - size of sources and sourceweights arrays (non-negative integer)
- maxoutdegree - size of destinations and destweights arrays (non-negative integer)

Output Parameters:
+ sources - processes for which the calling process is a destination (non-negative integer)
. sourceweights - weights of the edges into the calling process (non-negative integer)
. destinations - processes for which the calling process is a source (non-negative integer)
- destweights - weights of the edges out of the calling process (non-negative integer)
